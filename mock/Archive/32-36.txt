1st Frame : I was lucky to get a rickshaw at 3 in the midnight, as if it was godsend for me. I had to go to Kurla Station;
My house was close by. I usually leave in the evenings but that day I had some pending work so had to stretch to the late night. 

2nd Frame : I was exhausted and on top of this these bright neon lights.. So annoying!!! Why does a rickshaw need these neon lights!!!
This rickshaw was driving so fast. I believe in nights they always drive fast… Damn! No signal and a low battery…what a combo!

3rd Frame : The Rickshawala was speeding up as the meter went rolling. He was unusually fast… 
Within few minutes after being in the rickshaw, I felt a strange smell … 
Didn't know from where it was coming… But it was really bad, as if something was rotting.
It was distracting from time to time. Soon it became unbearable it was such a strong smell.
I could feel it coming from behind my seat…

4th Frame : And as I turned around to know what it was, I could see a big tiffin carrier which was kept in a dirty cotton bag.
It seemed like the cotton bag was stained with the oil because the tiffin carrier was left open. I just wondered why would someone leave such a bad smelling big Tiffin carrier in the rickshaw.

5th Frame : As I turned back to my normal position I realized that the rickshawala was staring at me through the auto mirror.
Before me asking him anything, he only started saying, “Kya saab, baas ka taqliff ho raha hai bahot?” 
I replied, “Kya hai ismein, kyu itna gandha baas aa raha hai?”
He says,” Aaj subah biwi se jhagda hua, isliye usne mujhe dabbe mein sade hue tamatar diye”.
